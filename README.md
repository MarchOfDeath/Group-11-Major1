# Group-11-Major1
This is the group project for the 1st Major assignment in 3600

### major1.c ###
// What does major1.c do, also indicate what happens in major1.h
// how to compile and run

### power.c ###
// What does power.c do

### reverse.c ###
// What does reverse.c do

### replace.c ###
// what does replace.c do
replace.c accepts 3 inputs from the user and manipulates the inital number by swapping one of its bits.
(1) User inputs a positive integer from 0-2,000,000,000 this will be the number being manipulated
(2) User inputs integer mask from 0-3,000,000,000 this will be the number that will be placed over integer (1) to become a mask
(3) User inputs integer value from 0-31 this value is the bit location to be flipped

### palindrome.c ###
// what does palindrome.c do

palindrome.c takes a positive integer less than 2 billion, converts the number into a binary number array.
  - The binary array is reversed into a new array
  - If the original binary array and the reversed binary array are the same, the number is a palindrome

Once the user inputs the required 3 values the program will raise the number 2 to the power of the input value (3) and replacing the bit coensiding with (1) to what the equivallent bit in (2).
